// this needs to be connected to the "new" Nexus file
// remove the VSANS references, match to SASCALC, write proper documentation, etc.
///////////

//
// this is a test of the "new" SANS file structure that is supposed to be
// NeXus compliant. It doesn't have the NICE logs, but has everything that I
// can think of here.
//

///
// for the simulator, routines to be able to write out a proper Nexus file
// based on a template
////

// overwrites the dummy values as needed with SASCALC information
//
// TODO
// issues here with the potential for Nexus to have data as INTEGER
// where I'd rather have the data here in Igor be DP, so there are no
// conversion/assignment issues
//
// simuation data from VCALC = DP, but I need to assign to an Integer wave...
// - sometimes this works, sometimes not...
// may need to Redimension/I
//
/// break this up into several smaller procedures as this is a VERY lengthy task to do

// TODO
// set the "accessible" copies of the data (these are really to be links in the file!)

//
// A "template" VSANS Nexus file has been loaded and is then filled in with
// the simulation results. Some of teh file, will therefor be garbage, but the
// overall structure and attributes should be correct.
//
// Hopefully this will make the maintenance and testing of the file structure easier...
// AUG 2015
//
///////////////////////////
//
// these are all of the VCALC changes to the simulated files. ADD to these as needed, making these changes to the
// folder structure after the "default" values have been re-filled in the waves (to make sure something is really there)
//
////////////////////////

// TODO:
//	-- Need to write all of the "accessors" to r/w all of the simulated bits to the data file... lots to do
// -- THIS DOES NOT MATCH THE CURRENT NICE_GENERATED FILE !!!!
//

//
// this is NOT linked in any way with SASCALC, and I have no idea
// of how to ever keep this in sync if the Nexus tree changes...
